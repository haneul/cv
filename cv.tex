%Distributed Systems, Computer Networking, Peer-to-peer Computing, \\ Operating Systems, World Wide Web, Privacy, Security
My research interests are primarily in networked systems. 
It spans topics like computer networking, operating systems, mobile services, privacy and security. 
Recently, I have worked on studying and providing solutions for smartphone privacy issues~\cite{spsm12,nsdi12,ccs2011}, 
and creating a new Internet architecture with censorship resistant property~\cite{hotnets11}.
Prior to studying in UW, I participated in various research projects, such as GPU-accelerated SSL~\cite{nsdi11}, 
and online social network analysis~\cite{www07}.
